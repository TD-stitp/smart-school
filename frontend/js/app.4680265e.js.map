precision\r\n// needs. Use the setMaxDigits() function to do this. See comments below.\r\n//\r\n// Tweaked by Ian Bunning\r\n// Alterations:\r\n// Fix bug in function biFromHex(s) to allow\r\n// parsing of strings of length != 0 (mod 4)\r\n\r\n// Changes made by Dave Shapiro as of 12/30/2004:\r\n//\r\n// The BigInt() constructor doesn't take a string anymore. If you want to\r\n// create a BigInt from a string, use biFromDecimal() for base-10\r\n// representations, biFromHex() for base-16 representations, or\r\n// biFromString() for base-2-to-36 representations.\r\n//\r\n// biFromArray() has been removed. Use biCopy() instead, passing a BigInt\r\n// instead of an array.\r\n//\r\n// The BigInt() constructor now only constructs a zeroed-out array.\r\n// Alternatively, if you pass <true>, it won't construct any array. See the\r\n// biCopy() method for an example of this.\r\n//\r\n// Be sure to set maxDigits depending on your precision needs. The default\r\n// zeroed-out array ZERO_ARRAY is constructed inside the setMaxDigits()\r\n// function. So use this function to set the variable. DON'T JUST SET THE\r\n// VALUE. USE THE FUNCTION.\r\n//\r\n// ZERO_ARRAY exists to hopefully speed up construction of BigInts(). By\r\n// precalculating the zero array, we can just use slice(0) to make copies of\r\n// it. Presumably this calls faster native code, as opposed to setting the\r\n// elements one at a time. I have not done any timing tests to verify this\r\n// claim.\r\n\r\n// Max number = 10^16 - 2 = 9999999999999998;\r\n//               2^53     = 9007199254740992;\r\n\r\nvar biRadixBase = 2;\r\nvar biRadixBits = 16;\r\nvar bitsPerDigit = biRadixBits;\r\nvar biRadix = 1 << 16; // = 2^16 = 65536\r\nvar biHalfRadix = biRadix >>> 1;\r\nvar biRadixSquared = biRadix * biRadix;\r\nvar maxDigitVal = biRadix - 1;\r\nvar maxInteger = 9999999999999998;\r\n\r\n// maxDigits:\r\n// Change this to accommodate your largest number size.
